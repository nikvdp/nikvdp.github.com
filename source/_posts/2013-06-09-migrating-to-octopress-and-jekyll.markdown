Wordpress has a lot of good points. It's plugin system is flexible and powerful, and this has made it extendable to the point where I can tolerate using it. For example, I can write my posts in markdown and have them automatically end up in HTML. 

Unfortunately, to support all this cool stuff wordpress has become bloated. I want to be able to write a post and toss it online in seconds, without thinking about it. Wordpress loadtimes kill, 1 or more seconds for a pageload, and adding a new post requires 3 or 4 clicks, so a simple post ends up taking > 30 seconds to get online. Plus, there's no offline support, and while plugins make markdown usable it's still a bit ugly.

Not acceptable. 

So, let's try Jekyll. Setting it up was a lot more difficult than I had originally thought. But it is working.
