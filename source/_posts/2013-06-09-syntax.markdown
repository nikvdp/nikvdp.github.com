Theoretically syntax highlighting in this is magical:

``` python
print "Hello there"
if a is not b:
    print "a isn't it"
```

Weird program


``` 
console.log("If this is as smart as it says");
console.log("It should be able to figure out this is javascript");
``` 

```
console.log "coffee"
```

``` 
if [[ $a == 1 ]]; then
    echo $a
fi
```
